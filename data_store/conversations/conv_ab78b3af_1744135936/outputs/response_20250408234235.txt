Step 1: Okay, I'm ready to proceed. However, I need more context. What was the "last prompt" you are referring to? Please provide the original task or instructions so I can determine the best tools to use and complete the task effectively.

Step 2: This is just a list of available tools and instructions. I need the actual task or question you want me to address. Please provide the specific task you want me to perform.

Step 3: You haven't provided a task yet. I need a description of the task you want me to accomplish before I can select the appropriate tools. Please tell me what you want me to do. For example, you could ask me to:
-   "Find the current weather in London."
-   "Summarize the main points of the latest news article about AI."
-   "Write a Python function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence."

Once you provide a task, I can analyze it and select the best tools to use.

Step 4: I understand that you are providing me with the tool list and instructions again. However, I still need the actual task you want me to perform. Please provide me with a specific request or question.

Step 5: It seems like you are stuck in a loop. I need you to provide me with a task or question. I cannot proceed without knowing what you want me to do. Please give me a specific instruction.

Step 6: I am still waiting for you to provide me with a task. I cannot do anything until you tell me what you want me to do. Please provide a specific instruction or question.

Step 7: I am designed to help you with tasks, but I need you to tell me what you want me to do. Please provide me with a specific task or question. I am repeating myself because you are repeating yourself.

Step 8: I am still missing the most important piece of information: the actual task! I cannot analyze anything or select any tools because you haven't told me *what* task you want me to analyze.

Please provide the task description. For example, are you trying to:
-   Find information about a specific topic?
-   Write some code?
-   Extract data from a website?
-   Analyze some data?

Once you tell me what you want to do, I can analyze the task and select the appropriate tools.

Step 9: ### Command Execution: `terminate`

```shell
The interaction has been completed with status: failure

Unable to determine task due to repeated provision of tool list and instructions without a task description.
