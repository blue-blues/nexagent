If you’re wondering whether investing in AI is still on the hype train, rest assured, it definitely is. 

While the large-scale investment rounds of 2021 (~$276B) and 2022 (~$189B) seem off the table, the chances to carve out a big slice of an investment pie are still significantly high:

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection A collectively hit a funding jackpot of $18B, topping the charts for the 2023 year.
In 2023, AI-focused companies became the hot pick for investors in the US startup arena, snagging over 25% of all investment dollars. 

So, take a deep breath, polish your pitch, and confidently approach AI investors. To help you cut through the crowd, we’ve handpicked the top 11 AI investors who are ready to open their wallets wide.

Mission
Artificial Intelligence for Europe

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most significant innovations in human history and is expected to transform nearly every industry. As AI enters the era of widespread application, Europe is well positioned to become a new hotspot for applied AI. 

AI.FUND is a highly-focused entrepreneurial investment fund dedicated to advancing AI from Europe. 

Our mission is to drive economic growth and prosperity by backing the development and adoption of AI solutions rooted in European values. We leverage our extensive experience as successful entrepreneurs, investors, and technology experts to back European AI leaders and connect them with the established economy.

Investment Focus and Value Creation

We invest in the most promising early-stage, AI-first startups in Europe and Israel which put AI at the heart of their impactful solution. We focus on the application of AI across all sectors with a special focus on four most promising areas of AI application: Enterprise AI, Vertical AI, Industrial AI, and Advanced AI Tech. Our preferred stages are seed and Series A rounds. We expect highly scalable products, clear customer traction, and the ambition to grow internationally, especially the U.S.

Enterprise AI
