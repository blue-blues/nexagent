Okay, I understand. Please provide me with the specific question or topic you'd like me to elaborate on in more detail. I need to know what you're referring to so I can give you a more comprehensive and detailed response. For example, you could say:

*   "More detail on the causes of the American Civil War."
*   "More detail on how photosynthesis works."
*   "More detail on the life of Marie Curie."
*   "More detail on how to calculate the area of a circle."

Once you give me the topic, I will provide a much more detailed and informative answer. I'm ready when you are!
