# Nexagent Architecture

## Overview

Nexagent is a powerful, intelligent agent framework that offers multiple specialized assistants. The architecture is designed to be modular, extensible, and capable of handling complex tasks through a combination of specialized agents, tools, and flows.

## Core Components

### Agents

Agents are the core intelligence units that process user requests and generate responses. Nexagent includes several specialized agents:

- **Integrated Agent**: Coordinates between specialized agents, routing requests to the appropriate agent based on content analysis.
- **Software Development Agent**: Specializes in code generation, debugging, and software architecture tasks.
- **Manus Agent**: General-purpose agent for handling a wide range of tasks.
- **Planning Agent**: Handles task planning and execution monitoring.
- **Parallel Agent**: Manages parallel execution of tasks.

### Flows

Flows define the execution patterns and coordination between agents and tools:

- **Integrated Flow**: Main flow that coordinates between different specialized agents.
- **Planning Flow**: Implements planning-based task execution.
- **Self-Improving Flow**: Implements mechanisms for agent self-improvement.
- **Parallel Flow**: Manages parallel execution of tasks.

### Tools

Tools are specialized components that agents can use to perform specific actions:

- **Browser Tools**: For web interaction and data extraction.
- **Terminal Tools**: For executing shell commands.
- **Code Analysis Tools**: For analyzing and understanding code.
- **Data Processing Tools**: For processing and transforming data.
- **Planning Tools**: For creating and managing execution plans.

## Data Flow

1. User input is received through the CLI or API interface.
2. The Integrated Flow analyzes the input and routes it to the appropriate specialized agent.
3. The agent processes the request, using tools as needed.
4. Results are returned to the user through the same interface.

## Session Management

The Session Manager maintains context across multiple interactions, allowing for continuous conversations and task execution.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through TOML files in the `config` directory, allowing for customization of agent behavior, tool settings, and API keys.

## Extension Points

Nexagent can be extended in several ways:

- **Custom Agents**: New specialized agents can be created by extending the base agent classes.
- **Custom Tools**: New tools can be added to provide additional capabilities.
- **Custom Flows**: New execution flows can be created to implement specialized processing patterns.
