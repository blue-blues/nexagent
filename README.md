Nexagent: Next‚ÄëGen Intelligent Data Extraction Agent
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/blue-blues/nexagent/raw/main/assets/nexagent-logo.png" alt="Nexagent Logo" width="250"/> <br><br> <strong>Your versatile AI agent for dynamic data extraction and intelligent processing</strong> <br><br> </div>


üöÄ Overview
Nexagent is a cutting‚Äëedge intelligent agent built for comprehensive data extraction and processing. Leveraging advanced AI and asynchronous execution, Nexagent is designed to:

Extract full content even from dynamic and complex sources.
Adapt dynamically to various data structures and anti‚Äëextraction measures.
Process and analyze data intelligently through multi‚Äëstep planning.
Handle complex data hierarchies with robust fallback mechanisms.
Integrate seamlessly with external APIs and local resources for enhanced functionality.
üåü Key Features
Advanced Data Extraction
Comprehensive extraction modes: Supports plain text, structured content, and dynamic page elements.
Stealth operation: Incorporates advanced anti‚Äëdetection techniques and randomized delays.
Adaptive parsing: Automatically detects, parses, and preserves document structure.
Asynchronous execution: Utilizes modern async/await patterns for non‚Äëblocking extraction.
Intelligent Processing & Reasoning
Dynamic step planning: Automatically adjusts execution steps based on task complexity.
Multi‚Äëlevel fallback: Implements retries, exponential backoff, and self‚Äëhealing strategies.
Smarter reasoning: Integrates enhanced LLM integrations for improved tool selection and decision making.
Context‚Äëaware insights: Prioritizes main content with intelligent prioritization of extraction targets.
Flexible & Modular Architecture
Modular tool system: Easily extend with new extraction strategies and processing modules.
Configurable behavior: Fine‚Äëtune settings via a simple TOML configuration file.
Robust dependency management: Automatically installs missing modules and verifies execution environments.
Seamless API integration: Supports external APIs (e.g., Google Gemini, Gemma API) for data enrichment.

üìä Advanced Features
Auto‚ÄëInstallation of Missing Modules
Nexagent now includes an auto‚Äëinstaller that scans for required Python modules before executing code. If a module is missing, it automatically installs it via pip, ensuring smoother execution.

Enhanced Reasoning & Fallback Mechanisms
Smarter LLM Integration:
Nexagent now uses improved LLM logic to generate meaningful ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù and decides which tools to execute based on context.
Adaptive API Delays:
Implements configurable delays and dynamic backoff to prevent rate limit issues.
Loop Escape Strategies:
Detects repetitive execution cycles and adjusts the workflow to ensure continuous progress.
